I think the california screening dataset's perfect for analysis :) over 8000 rows, with Asthma rate and Cardiovascular prevalence
and lots of air pollution factors and 6 socioeconomic factors

need to change: 1. from 51 states to 1 state with lots of zip codes. Maybe  use zip codes as the identifier
need to ask in OH: HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THE NAs
There are at most 200ish NAs in one of the columns 
and 100ish NAs for a few other columns
In forward selection model these NAs have to be removed


(the AIC is pretty big thou)
The desired model: 
Asthma ~ Pop.Char. + LinguisticIsolation + DrinkingWater + CardiovascularDisease + 
    Ozone + Education + LowBirthWeight + HousingBurden + DieselPM + 
    Unemployment + Traffic + CleanupSites + Tox.Release + Imp.WaterBodies + 
    PollutionBurden + PM2.5 + GroundwaterThreats + Haz.Waste
