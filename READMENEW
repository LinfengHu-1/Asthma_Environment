Pluto: I explored the california screening dataset 2018 a lil bit last night and I think it's perfect for analysis :) over 8000 rows, with Asthma rate and Cardiovascular prevalence
and lots of air pollution factors and 6 socioeconomic factors

I dont think we need to change our written plan much, in terms of the variables
What we do need to change: 1. from 51 states to 1 state with lots of zip codes. Maybe we should use zip codes as the identifier
Just one thing to keep in mind and we need to ask her in her OH: HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THE NAs
There are at most 200ish NAs in one of the columns 
and 100ish NAs for a few other columns
When I run the forward selection model they haveto be removed


(the AIC is pretty big thou)
The desired model: 
Asthma ~ Pop.Char. + LinguisticIsolation + DrinkingWater + CardiovascularDisease + 
    Ozone + Education + LowBirthWeight + HousingBurden + DieselPM + 
    Unemployment + Traffic + CleanupSites + Tox.Release + Imp.WaterBodies + 
    PollutionBurden + PM2.5 + GroundwaterThreats + Haz.Waste
